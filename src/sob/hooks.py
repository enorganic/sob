    Instances of this class hold functions ("hooks") to be executed
    at various points during marshalling, un-marshalling, serializing,
    de-serializing or validation.

    Please note the following context-specific definitions:

    - marshal: To convert an instance of an `sob.Model` sub-class into data
        suitable for serializing with `json.dumps`. For example, marshalling
        an instance of `sob.Dictionary`, or marshalling an instance of a
        sub-class of `sob.Object`, would result in a `dict` object.
    - unmarshal: To convert data de-serialized using `json.loads` into an
        instance of an `sob.Model` sub-class. For example, un-marshalling a
        `dict` object could return in an instance of `sob.Dictionary`
        (this would be the default if no types were specified), or could
        return an instance of one of the `sob.Model` sub-classes
        specified in the `types` parameter passed to `sob.unmarshal`.
    - serialize: To convert a marshalled object into a JSON string.
    - deserialize: To convert a JSON string into a python-native object.
    - validate: To check that the data held by a model instance is in
        compliance with that model's metadata. Because data types are
        enforced when attributes are set, validation only entails verifying
        that all required attributes are present, and that no extraneous
        attributes are present. Validation is only initiated explicitly,
        by passing a model instance to the `sob.validate` function.

    Attributes:
        before_marshal: A function called *before* marshalling a model.
            The `before_marshal` function should accept deserialized JSON
            data (pre-marshalling) as the first argument, and return the
            same type of data (or `None`) as the return value.
        after_marshal: A function to be called *after* marshalling a model.
            The `after_marshal` function should accept an instance of the
            class to which it is associated as the only argument, and must
            return an instance of that class as the return value.
        before_unmarshal: A function to be called *before* un-marshalling a
            model. The `before_unmarshal` function should accept an
            instance of the class to which it is associated as the only
            argument, and must return an instance of that class as the
            return value.
        after_unmarshal: A function to be called *after* un-marshalling a
            model. The `after_unmarshal` function should accept
            unmarshalled, but pre-serialized, JSON serializable data as
            the first argument, and return the same type of data (or
            `None`) as the return value.
        before_serialize: A function to be called before serializing a
            model. The `before_serialize` function should accept
            unmarshalled, but pre-serialized, JSON serializable data as
            the first argument, and return the same type of data (or
            `None`) as the return value. For most use cases, assigning a
            function to `after_unmarshal` and to `before_serialize` will
            produce the same result, however it is technically possible to
            unmarshal data without ever serializing it, so both hooks are
            provided.
        after_serialize: A function to be called after serializing a model.
            The `after_serialize` function should accept a JSON string as
            the only argument, and return a JSON string as the return
            value.
        before_validate: A function to be called before validating a model.
            The `before_validate` function should accept an instance of the
            class to which it is associated as the only argument, and must
            return an instance of that class as the return value.

        compliance with that model's metadata. Because data types are
        enforced when attributes are set, validation only entails verifying
        that all required attributes are present, and that no extraneous
        attributes are present. Validation is only initiated explicitly,
        by passing a model instance to the `sob.validate` function.

    Attributes:
        before_marshal: A function called *before* marshalling a model.
            The `before_marshal` function should accept deserialized JSON
            data (pre-marshalling) as the first argument, and return the
            same type of data (or `None`) as the return value.
        after_marshal: A function to be called *after* marshalling a model.
            The `after_marshal` function should accept an instance of the
            class to which it is associated as the only argument, and must
            return an instance of that class as the return value.
        before_unmarshal: A function to be called *before* un-marshalling a
            model. The `before_unmarshal` function should accept an
            instance of the class to which it is associated as the only
            argument, and must return an instance of that class as the
            return value.
        after_unmarshal: A function to be called *after* un-marshalling a
            model. The `after_unmarshal` function should accept
            unmarshalled, but pre-serialized, JSON serializable data as
            the first argument, and return the same type of data (or
            `None`) as the return value.
        before_serialize: A function to be called before serializing a
            model. The `before_serialize` function should accept
            unmarshalled, but pre-serialized, JSON serializable data as
            the first argument, and return the same type of data (or
            `None`) as the return value. For most use cases, assigning a
            function to `after_unmarshal` and to `before_serialize` will
            produce the same result, however it is technically possible to
            unmarshal data without ever serializing it, so both hooks are
            provided.
        after_serialize: A function to be called after serializing a model.
            The `after_serialize` function should accept a JSON string as
            the only argument, and return a JSON string as the return
            value.
        before_validate: A function to be called before validating a model.
            The `before_validate` function should accept an instance of the
            class to which it is associated as the only argument, and must
            return an instance of that class as the return value.
        after_validate: A function to be called after validating a model.
            The `after_validate` function should accept an instance of the
            class to which it is associated as the only argument, and must
            return an instance of that class as the return value.
        before_setitem: A function to be called before assigning a value
            to an object by key. The `before_setitem` function should accept 3
            positional arguments: an instance of the class to which it is
            associated, the item key, and the value to be assigned to that
            key. The function should return a tuple containing a
            key and a value to be assigned.
        after_setitem: A function to be called after assigning a value
            to an object by key. The `before_setitem` function should accept 3
            positional arguments: an instance of the class to which it is
            associated, the item key, and the value assigned to that
            key. The function should return `None`.
